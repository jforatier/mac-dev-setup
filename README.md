## How to open Visual Studio Code from the command line on OSX? [source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29971430)

_Tip: If you want to run VS Code from the terminal by simply typing 'code', VS Code has a command, Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH, to add 'code' to your $PATH variable list._

After installation, launch VS Code. Now open the Command Palette (F1 or â‡§+âŒ˜+P on Mac) and type `shell command` to find the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.`

After executing the command, restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to simply type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.
